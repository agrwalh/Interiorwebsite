                House of Culture Project in Warsaw's Żoliborz District <br>
                The task of the project was to create a building with thoughtful interior design for the Żoliborz district along Aleja Wojska Polskiego. The iconic Brukalski house, representing modernist standards, served as inspiration for the shape of the House of Culture.
                 Adopting rounded forms allowed it to blend perfectly into the existing architecture of the area. <br>
                Entry to the building is through a glazed vestibule leading to a spacious reception area, where a large corner desk for the staff is located.
                 The ground floor of the House of Culture includes a painting studio and a cozy café, creating a friendly atmosphere.
                 Behind the reception area is a staircase equipped with an elevator, ensuring easy access to the upper floor for people with limited mobility. The first floor welcomes us with a spacious hall, featuring a unique semi-circular sofa as the main element.
                  It is also on this floor that the expansive dance hall is located, providing ample space for various activities. <br>
                Each floor is equipped with toilets for both men and women, as well as a dedicated toilet for disabled people. Additionally, the presence of an elevator on each floor enables unrestricted movement for all visitors.
