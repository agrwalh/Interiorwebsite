                General Description:
                The subject of my engineering thesis was the interior design of a café for youth, open seasonally to an outdoor garden. The building I designed is a small extension located near the former Wrzos cinema, situated on church grounds. There are many schools nearby, so I aimed to create a café primarily for young people to relax after a day at school. Of course, I wanted everyone—not just young people—to feel comfortable in this place.
                The characteristic features of this place are large windows spanning the entire wall and an interesting roof, consisting of a balcony attached to the main building and transparent polycarbonate panels that allow even more light into the room. Despite the abundant natural light, the interior seemed quite gloomy due to its dark colors, which visually narrowed the café space. Regarding the café's functionality, there was no social space for employees. The bar was quite small, and there was not enough room for employees to move freely while performing their duties.
                Knowing that I would use light colors in this space, I decided to use light oak cabinet fronts with white countertops for the bar. The table tops are also in white, complemented by Modzelewski designer green chairs. I changed the floor color to warm oak. I laid the floorboards perpendicular to the windows, which visually widened the narrow space. Opposite the window, I placed a large mirror angled to reflect not the ceiling, but the view outside. On another wall, I opted for waterproof, beige wallpaper with delicate patterns.
                By partitioning the café with partition walls, I managed to create three additional rooms for employees: a social room, utility room, and dishwashing area. There is no restroom in the extension, but it is located behind glass doors leading to the main building, accessible to both customers and staff.
                Another important aspect of my thesis was a large garden, which inspired me to incorporate a pergola. I drew inspiration from Artosi. The pergola roof is constructed of rotating louvers that can be adjusted to control the angle. During rain, water drains from the louvers into gutter systems integrated within the pergola around the perimeter frame. From the gutter, water flows through designated columns, where a pipe directs it outside the pergola.
                In the evening, ground-recessed lamps around the pergola will illuminate the surrounding trees. These lamps are controlled by a twilight sensor.
