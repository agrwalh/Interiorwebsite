                Apartment project for an Ecologist <br>
                Based on the provided floor plan, the task was to design an apartment for an Ecologist. The ecologist's apartment is located in a quiet area surrounded by greenery and nature-friendly surroundings. The interior is decorated in natural colors, using materials from renewable sources. The space has been optimized for functionality and minimalism, encouraging simple, sustainable daily living. The apartment is equipped with energy-efficient appliances. The kitchen features eco-friendly household appliances, while the bathroom utilizes water-saving fixtures and hypoallergenic products. The bedroom includes a bed and pallet nightstands.
