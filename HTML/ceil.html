                The theme of my project is glasses. <br>
                The goal of this project is for everyone to feel as if they are wearing glasses, because looking through one of the windows gives you that feeling. 
                The project uses drywall for the walls. The main wall, shaped like glasses, is painted black to give character to the exhibition. The rest of the walls are white. 
                The floor is covered with gray micro-cement. The table on which there are 3 pairs of exclusive glasses is in the same colors as the floor. Black and white colors are also used in the customer area to match the exhibition.
