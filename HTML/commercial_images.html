                General Description <br>
                The concept involved transforming a cultural house designed by me for the Å»oliborz district. The shape of the building was preserved and the interior was redesigned. <br>
                This project is dedicated to people who love being close to nature, hence the natural colors prevailing there. The floor is covered with Claudi Cemento microcement in olive shade. The walls are painted with waterproof magnat paint in pure white color. 
                On one of the walls, I decided to place moss chrobotka, which not only perfectly fits into the room but also has positive properties such as filtering air including toxins and dust and unpleasant smells.
                In addition, well-impregnated moss is antistatic, so it does not attract dust, insects, and microorganisms. On the next wall, I hung a mirror across its entire length, which reflects what is happening opposite, creating a "natural" wallpaper at the same time. 
                A large olive tree in a concrete pot was placed in the central part of the room, which additionally emphasizes the unique character of the interior. <br>
                To maintain consistency between the bar and the consumption area, cabinet fronts in the same shade as the floor and pot were used. 
                Additionally, the suspended ceiling above the bar was enriched with elements of moss chrobotka, which are illuminated by Shila Hawana LED diodes. The whole composition is emphasized by chairs in an intense fuchsia color, which fit perfectly into the entire design project.
